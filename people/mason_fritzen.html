                <p>Mason Fritzen is a recent graduate of Purdue University with a degree in Electrical Engineering.
                    His senior design project was a medical sensor for IV bags in hospitals, and his subsystem was a central device at 
                    the nurses' station that managed the rest of the system. The project was based around an STM32F0 microcontroller.
                     He was the first student to graduate under the mentorship program. He also made this website for the Joshua J. 
                     Summers Engineering Opportunities program.
