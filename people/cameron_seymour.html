                    <p>Cameron Seymour hails from Hillsboro, Indiana where he went to a small rural high school named Fountain Central. 
                        Cameron was accepted into the First Year Engineering program at Purdue University. After FYE, Cameron chose to 
                        pursue his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering with a minor in Land Surveying. After graduating in May 2014, 
                        Cameron began his career practicing offshore surveying in the oil and gas industry out of Houston, Texas. In 2016, 
                        he brought his talents back to West Lafayette and started as a Project Designer for Schneider Geomatics. His 
                        proximity to Purdue allowed him to pursue his passion of mentoring and trying to help students navigate the 
                        experiences, triumphs, and tribulations of an engineering education. His goal for the mentoring program is to 
                        increase the graduation rate of engineering students from small rural schools and also create networking opportunities 
                        for career placement.
